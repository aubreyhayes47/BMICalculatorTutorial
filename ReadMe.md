# BMI Calculator Tutorial Project

This project, written in Java, is the source code for a simple Android application that calculates BMI. Users select which units they want to input for height and weight, and the calculator lets them know if they fall into a normal weight range, underweight, overweight, or one of the three categories of obesity.

I created this application by following along with a tutorial designed to show those who are already familiar with Java how to use Android Studio to create a basic application. I modified it slightly to remove the illustrations from the tutorial and include obesity categories rather than just "obese."

The tutorial involved is available on Coursera at [Android Programming for Beginners - A Simple BMI Calculator](https://www.coursera.org/projects/android-programming-for-beginners)
